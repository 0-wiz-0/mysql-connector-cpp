Dear MySQL Users,

A new GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has
been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.6 GA. The MySQL
Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for connecting client applications to
the MySQL Server 5.5 or newer. You can download the production release
at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.1.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC
4.0. MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since years.

The major changes in 1.1.6 are:

       option was specified and the MySQL installation path
       contained the characters -m. Installation failed if the
       build directory was not in the top source directory. (Bug
       #73502, Bug #19447498)

     * For prepared statements, getString() did not return the
       fractional seconds part from temporal columns that had a
       fractional sections part. (Bug #68523, Bug #17218692)

     * For queries of the form SELECT MAX(bit_col) FROM
       table_with_bit_col, getString() returned an incorrect
       result. (Bug #66235, Bug #14520822)

     * For Connector/C++ builds from source, make install failed
       if only the static library had been built without the
       dynamic library. (Bug #52281, Bug #11759926)
