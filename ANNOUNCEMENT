Dear MySQL Users,

A new GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.4 GA. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for
connecting client applications to the MySQL Server 5.1 or newer. You can download the production release at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.1.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC 4.0. MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since years. 

The major changes in 1.1.4 are:

- Both static and dynamic driver libraries now linked against libmysql library
  statically(Bug#16664970 "Connector/C++ 1.1.3 will *not* wort with mysql 5.5" and
  Bug#16701312 "libmysqlcppconn-static.a has unresolved symbols for all libmysqlclient functions")

- Built against libmysql 5.6.11

You can find further details, including usages examples, in the documentation at:
