Building Connector/C++ 2.0  {#building}
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------
To build Connector/C++, the following tools and libraries are required:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11. These compilers have
  been tested: gcc 4.8.4, MS Visual Studio 2013.

- CMake 2.8.11 or later.

- Boost library version 1.55 or higher. Tested with Boost 1.56.

Build configuration
-------------------
Only out-of-source builds are supported. To configure build, execute
`cmake` in a dedicated build location (not in the source directory)
as usual:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake -G ... -D ... <Connector/C++ source location>
~~~~~~~

If `cmake` can not find correct Boost version, or if it is installed
in non-standard location, specify correct location using option:

- `-DWITH_BOOST=<Boost location>`

To specify installation location (see below), use option:

- `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<Install location>`

If not specified, the install location defaults to
`/usr/local/mysql/connector-c++-2.0` (`<User home>/MySQL/"MySQL Connector C++ 2.0"`
on Windows).

Building and testing
--------------------
A build can be started with the following cmake invocation in the build
location:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake --build . --config=CCC
~~~~~~~

where `CCC` is the build configuration to use, such as `Release`
or `Debug`.

After a successful build, the build location shouild contain
the Connector/C++ static library `libmysql_concpp.a`
(`CCC/mysql_concpp.lib` on Windows).

### Testing

To perform basic testing of the functionality, build and run the
test program included in the `test` subdirectory of the source location.
A running MySQL 5.7 Server instance is needed to run the `test`
application (see below).

Before building the `test` program, Connector/C++ must be installed
first. To instal Connector/C++ to the default location or to the one specified 
with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option during the configuration process,
execute the following command in the build location:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake --build . --target install
~~~~~~~

To build the `test` program, run `cmake` again. After picking
a build location for `test`, issue the following commands there:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake -G ... -DWITH_CONCPLS=<Connector/C++ install location> <source location>/test
$ cmake --build . --target test
~~~~~~~

This should create the `test` executable in the build location.

Before running `test`, ensure that a MySQL Server instance
is running with MySQL Hybrid plugin loaded into it. The easiest way of
arranging this is to use `mysql-test-run.pl` script from MySQL Server
distribution. In the `mysql-test` subdirectory of that distribution,
invoke this command:

~~~~~~~
$ perl mysql-test-run.pl --start-and-exit --mysqld=--plugin-load=mysqlx
~~~~~~~

This should start a test server instance with MySQL Hybrid plugin loaded
into it. When started like this, the plugin will listen on port 13010
instead of the standard 33060 one.

Now one can start the `test` program and see the output similar to the
one presented below. The program accepts port number as the first argument,
with the default value 33060. Thus, if the server was started as described
previously, run the test program as follows:

~~~~~~~
$ test 13010
~~~~~~~

The program uses the `root` user account without any password and assumes
that there is a `test` schema in the server (these assumptions hold for
a server started using `mysql-test-run.pl`). Different user credentials
can be passed as the second and the third argument of `test` invocation.

If everything goes well, `test` should produce output similar to this:

Done!

Windows Notes
-------------
On Windows one can request that Connector/C++ uses the static runtime
library (The `/MT*` compiler option) by setting:

- `-DSTATIC_MSVCRT=yes`

This might be necessary if code which uses Connector/C++ also uses
the static runtime.

@todo
  Document caveats with Debug/Release mismatch.

OS X Notes
----------
On OS X, Connector/C++ is built using the `clang` compiler with the `libc++`
C++ runtime library. The same runtime library should be used by
applications that link against Connector/C++. To arrange this,
pass `-stdlib=libc++` to compiler and linker invocations. Another option is
to set the required deployment target and then compiler defaults
are changed accordingly. To define the deployment target, set the nevironment
variable `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to the requested OS X version.
Binary distributions of Connector/C++ are built with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`
set to `10.9`.

Building Connector/C++ with `gcc` or its `libstdc++` runtime
implementation has not been tested and there is no support in the build
system for using an alternative C++ runtime library.
