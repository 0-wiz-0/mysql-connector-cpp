Using Connector/C++ 2.0  {#usage}
=======================

Assume that Connector/C++ was installed to _MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR_ location.

When compiling code which uses MySQL Connector/C++ one should add
_MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR_`/include` to the include path of the project, and
link compiled code with _MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR_`/lib/mysqlconcpp.a` library
as well as `pthread` library on which Connector/C++ depends.

Example `Makefile` to build a simple application with sources in `app.cc`
would look as follows:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = pthread

app : app.o $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib/mysqlconcpp.a
~~~~~~~

To use Connector/C++ API source code should contain `#include <mysqlx.h>`
directive. All Connector/C++ API symbols live in `mysqlx` namespace.
