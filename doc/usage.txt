Using Connector/C++ 2.0  {#usage}
=======================

When compiling code which uses MySQL Connector/C++, add
`<Connector/C++ install location>/include` to the include path of
the project, and link compiled code with
the `<Connector/C++ install location>/lib/libmysql_concpp.a` library
as well as the `pthread` library on which Connector/C++ depends.

Since Connector/C++ uses C++11 language, one should enable C++11 support
in the compiler, unless it is the default. For `gcc` and `clang`
compilers this can be done using `-std=c++11` option.

An example `Makefile` to build an application using Connector/C++,
with sources in `app.cc` looks like this:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = pthread
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11
LINK.o = $(LINK.cc)  # use c++ linker

app : app.o $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib/libmysql_concpp.a
~~~~~~~

To use Connector/C++ API the source code should include the `mysqlx.h` header.
All Connector/C++ API symbols live in the `mysqlx` namespace.

OS X Notes
----------

Binary distribution of Connector/C++ for OS X is compiled using the
OS X native `clang` compiler. For that reason it is best to build
an application that uses the connector with the same `clang` compiler.

The `clang` compiler can use two different implementations of
the C++ runtime library: either the native `libc++` or the GNU `libstdc++`
library. It is important that an application uses the same runtime implementation
as Connector/C++, that is, the native `libc++`. To ensure that, the
`-stdlib=libc++` option should be passed to compiler and linker invocations.

A `Makefile` for OS X build might look as follows:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR= ...
CPPFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = pthread
CXX = clang++ -stdlib=libc++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11
LINK.o = $(LINK.cc)  # use c++ linker

app : app.o $(MYSQL_CONCPP_DIR)/lib/libmysql_concpp.a
~~~~~~~
