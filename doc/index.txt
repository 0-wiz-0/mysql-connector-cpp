MySQL Connector/C++ Documentation  {#mainpage}
=================================

Connector/C++ is a library for applications written in C++ that want to
communicate with MySQL database servers. Version 2.0 of Connector/C++
implements the new MySQL DevAPI.

Sample code which uses Connector/C++ to connect to a database, create
collection, add few documents and then query them might look as
follows:

@include test.cc
